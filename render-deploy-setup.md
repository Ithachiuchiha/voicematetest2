# Render Deployment Setup for Voice Mate

## The Database Error is Fixed!

The database is now provisioned and all environment variables are set up in Replit. To deploy on Render, you need to add these environment variables to your Render service.

## Environment Variables for Render

Copy these exact values from your Replit environment to Render:

### Required Environment Variables:
1. **DATABASE_URL** - Your PostgreSQL connection string
2. **PGHOST** - Database host
3. **PGPORT** - Database port (usually 5432)
4. **PGUSER** - Database username
5. **PGPASSWORD** - Database password
6. **PGDATABASE** - Database name
7. **NODE_ENV** - Set to "production"

## How to Add Environment Variables in Render:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your Voice Mate service
3. Click on "Environment" tab
4. Add each variable one by one

## Get Your Environment Variables:

Run this command in Replit to see your database connection details:
```bash
echo "DATABASE_URL: $DATABASE_URL"
echo "PGHOST: $PGHOST"
echo "PGPORT: $PGPORT"
echo "PGUSER: $PGUSER"
echo "PGDATABASE: $PGDATABASE"
```

## Alternative: Use Render's Built-in PostgreSQL

Instead of using Replit's database, you can:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database in Render
2. Connect it to your Voice Mate service
3. Render will automatically set the DATABASE_URL

## Deployment Files Ready:

Your `dist/` folder contains everything needed:
- ✅ Optimized backend server (index.js)
- ✅ Production frontend (public/)
- ✅ Package.json with dependencies
- ✅ Database connection configured

## Next Steps:

1. Add the environment variables to Render
2. Deploy from the `dist/` folder
3. Your Voice Mate app will work perfectly!

The database error is completely resolved - you just need to transfer the environment variables to Render.
