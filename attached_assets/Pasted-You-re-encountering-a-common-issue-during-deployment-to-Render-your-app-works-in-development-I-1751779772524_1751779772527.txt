You're encountering a common issue during deployment to **Render**: your app works in development (IDE) where you've provided the **Supabase Database URL** (or `.env` config), but after deploying to Render, it's **not using the correct Supabase URL** in production.

---

### 🔍 Likely Problem:

Render is **not picking up your Supabase environment variables**, or the wrong ones are being used at runtime.

When you **build locally**, it uses your `.env` file (like `.env.local` or `.env.development`). But on **Render**, unless you **manually configure your environment variables**, it has no idea what `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, etc. are.

### ✅ Solution: Add Your Supabase Environment Variables in Render

#### 🔧 Step-by-step:

1. **Login to Render Dashboard**

2. Go to your deployed **Web Service**

3. In the sidebar, go to **Environment > Environment Variables**

4. Add the following variables (copy them from your `.env` file):

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

   Optionally:

   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  // only if you're using Admin APIs
   ```

5. **Redeploy** your site after adding them.

### 🧠 Common Mistake to Avoid:

* Do **not hardcode** the Supabase URL into your frontend or code files.
* Always use `process.env.SUPABASE_URL` (or the appropriate variable based on your stack).

---

### 📦 If You're Using Next.js:

Ensure you have:

```js
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)
```

And in Render, make sure those variables are **prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`** to expose them to the frontend.

### 🧪 Quick Test

To confirm it's working on Render:

* Add a temporary route like `/env-check` that logs `process.env.SUPABASE_URL` and test if it matches your Supabase project.

If you still face issues, please tell me:

* What stack you're using (Next.js? Vite? CRA?)
* How you're using Supabase (via `@supabase/supabase-js`?)
* What exactly is the error on the deployed site?

I'll guide you through debugging it precisely.
