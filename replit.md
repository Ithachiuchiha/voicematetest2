# Voice Mate - PWA Development Guide

## Overview

Voice Mate is a Progressive Web App that combines voice diary, task management, and timetable features with intelligent voice-to-text conversion. The application is built as a full-stack TypeScript application using React for the frontend and Express for the backend, with a focus on voice interaction and local storage capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Voice Integration**: Web Speech API through custom hooks
- **PWA Features**: Service Worker, Web App Manifest, offline capabilities

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development**: Vite for development server and HMR
- **Build**: ESBuild for production bundling
- **Storage**: In-memory storage with planned PostgreSQL integration
- **API**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Development**: In-memory storage using Maps
- **Production Ready**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Local Storage**: Browser localStorage for offline functionality
- **Database Options**: 
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL) - Recommended for free deployment
  - Neon Database (PostgreSQL) with connection pooling
  - Firebase (requires payment for functions)

## Key Components

### Voice Recognition System
- Custom `useVoiceRecognition` hook wrapping Web Speech API
- Continuous listening with interim results
- Error handling and browser compatibility checks
- Language configuration support

### Data Models
- **Diary Entries**: Date-based content with timestamps
- **Tasks**: Kanban-style with status tracking (not_started, started, progress, completed, halted)
- **Schedule Items**: Time-based with repeat patterns (daily, weekdays, weekends, custom)

### UI Components
- **DiaryCalendar**: Calendar view with entry management
- **KanbanBoard**: Task management with drag-and-drop functionality
- **TimetableManager**: Schedule creation and management
- **VoiceRecorder**: Central voice input component
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation between features

### PWA Features
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Web App Manifest for installability
- Local storage fallback for offline usage
- Push notification support (planned)

## Data Flow

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks into microphone
2. **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API converts speech to text
3. **Processing**: Text is processed and categorized (diary, task, or schedule)
4. **Storage**: Data is sent to backend API and stored
5. **UI Update**: React Query invalidates cache and updates UI
6. **Offline Sync**: Local storage maintains data during offline periods

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React, React DOM
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS, class-variance-authority
- **Utilities**: date-fns, clsx, cmdk

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple (configured for PostgreSQL sessions)

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, ESBuild, TypeScript
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Linting**: Built-in TypeScript checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite development server with HMR
- In-memory storage for rapid development
- Replit-specific configuration for cloud development

### Production Build
1. Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. Backend: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. Static files served by Express in production
4. Database migrations applied via Drizzle Kit

### Database Migration
- Drizzle migrations stored in `./migrations`
- Schema defined in `./shared/schema.ts`
- Push command: `npm run db:push`

### Environment Configuration
- `NODE_ENV` for environment detection
- `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
- Replit-specific development features enabled conditionally

## Capacitor Integration

### Android APK Conversion
- **Configuration**: `capacitor.config.ts` with complete app settings
- **Build Script**: `prepare-android.sh` for automated setup
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for deployment

### Mobile Features
- Native notifications with custom sounds
- Microphone permissions for voice recording
- Offline storage and sync capabilities
- Native splash screen and status bar theming
- Haptic feedback integration

### Required Dependencies
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/android @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/splash-screen @capacitor/status-bar @capacitor/keyboard
npm install @capacitor/local-notifications @capacitor/haptics @capacitor/device
npm install @capacitor/network @capacitor/storage @capacitor/filesystem
```

### Build Commands
- `bash prepare-android.sh` - Automated Android setup
- `npx cap sync android` - Sync web assets with native project
- `npx cap open android` - Open Android Studio for APK building

## Documentation Files

### Core Documentation
- **CAPACITOR_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step Capacitor installation and configuration
- **DEPENDENCIES_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Complete library documentation with functions
- **APP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: PWA and Android deployment instructions

### Key Features Documented

## Firebase Deployment

### Complete Firebase Hosting Setup
Voice Mate is fully configured for Firebase deployment with zero functionality loss:

#### **Firebase Configuration Files**
- `firebase.json` - Hosting and Functions configuration
- `functions/index.js` - Express API converted to Firebase Functions
- `functions/package.json` - Functions dependencies
- `deploy-firebase.sh` - Automated deployment script

#### **Deployment Process**
1. **Build Project**: `npm run build` (builds React frontend)
2. **Deploy**: `bash deploy-firebase.sh` (deploys to Firebase)
3. **All Features Preserved**: Voice recognition, task detection, data persistence

#### **Firebase Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Firebase Hosting serves React PWA
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions handle all API routes
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (can upgrade to Firestore)
- **Domain**: Custom Firebase domain with HTTPS

#### **What Works on Firebase**
âœ… Voice recognition (client-side Web Speech API)  
âœ… Intelligent task/diary detection  
âœ… All API endpoints via Firebase Functions  
âœ… Progressive Web App features  
âœ… Mobile responsiveness  
âœ… Real-time data persistence  

## Supabase Migration

### Complete Supabase Integration
Voice Mate now supports Supabase as the recommended database solution:

#### **Why Supabase Over Firebase**
- **No Payment Requirements**: Generous free tier with 50,000 monthly active users
- **Real PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent data storage vs Firebase's in-memory limitation
- **Better Free Features**: Real-time capabilities, database browser, SQL editor
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Standard PostgreSQL compatible with other platforms

#### **Migration Options**
1. **Railway Deployment**: Free hosting with automated setup via `supabase-railway-deploy.sh`
2. **Render Deployment**: Free Node.js hosting with Supabase database
3. **Replit + Supabase**: Keep current Replit setup, add DATABASE_URL secret
4. **Supabase Edge Functions**: Native Supabase hosting (coming soon)

#### **Migration Files Created**
- `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration documentation
- `supabase-setup-instructions.md` - Quick 5-minute setup guide
- `supabase-railway-deploy.sh` - Automated Railway deployment script

#### **What's Preserved**
âœ… All voice recognition functionality  
âœ… Intelligent task detection and categorization  
âœ… Progressive Web App features  
âœ… Mobile responsiveness and PWA installation  
âœ… All UI components and interactions  
âœ… Local storage for offline functionality  

#### **What's Improved**
